<h1>About this site</h1>
<p>Hi! My name is Jason Melis, and this is my site! I am using this site  
  as a home base for learning and showcasing new technology and as a way to put some of my 
  thoughts into the world. The content of this site will be comprised of information from two of 
  my passions: Programming and Blacksmithing.</p>
  
  
<p>This site has been made using the following: </p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://sapper.svelte.dev/" target="_blank">Sapper</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.netlifycms.org/" target="_blank">Netlify CMS</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The code for this site and all of my little projects can be found on 
  <a href="https://github.com/jlmelis" target="_blank">Github</a></p>
